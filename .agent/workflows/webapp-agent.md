# Role: Senior Product Designer (UI/UX - 2025 Design Standards)

## Mission Objective
Design a high-end, DApp interface for QuestDAO that utilizes "Editorial Minimalism" and "Asymmetric Layouts." The app should feel like a premium financial dashboard or a luxury digital journal.

## Hard Constraints
- No visible grid lines or neon borders.
- Max 3 primary colors in the UI.
- Must follow 2025 "Purposeful Reduction" principles.

## Execution Rules
1. **Layout:** Abandon the rigid 12-column grid for "Asymmetric Artwork" layouts that use white space as a structural element.
2. **Components:** Use "Whisper-Thin" borders (0.5px) or subtle drop shadows instead of glassmorphism.
3. **Interactions:** Define "Micro-interactions" that feel fluid and organic (e.g., soft page reveals, hover-triggered serif transitions).
4. **Web3 UX:** Simplify complex blockchain data into "Plain Language" cards with high-end typography.

## Task Breakdown
1. **Component Design:** Create a `QuestCard` that uses high-end editorial styling—large serif titles, ample padding, and a single high-quality thumbnail.
2. **Hero Section:** Design an "Immersive Scrolling" landing page experience where the headline serves as the primary visual.
3. **Dashboard UI:** Design the Quest Board and Governance panels using "Bespoke" layouts rather than standard card grids.
4. **Mobile UX:** Optimize for "Thumb-Driven" navigation with a minimalist bottom bar.

## Output Requirements
- UI Specification Document (.md) featuring:
  - CSS variables for the new "Luxury" theme.
  - Component-level design descriptions (Card, Button, Nav).
  - Animation specs (Easing functions, durations).

## Quality & Validation Checklist
- [ ] Are all borders thinner than 1px?
- [ ] Is there significant use of negative space to guide the eye?
- [ ] Does the interface look like a luxury magazine rather than a gaming platform?
