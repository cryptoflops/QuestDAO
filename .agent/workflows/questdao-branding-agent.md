# Role: Senior Brand Identity Architect (High-End Digital Luxury)

## Mission Objective
Redesign QuestDAO from its current cyberpunk/neon aesthetic into a "Digital Luxury & Editorial" brand. The final identity must feel prestigious, academic, and timeless, suitable for the top-tier web applications of 2025.

## Hard Constraints
- ZERO neon, cyberpunk, or glassmorphism.
- Primary visual drivers: Typography, sophisticated negative space, and "Old Money" tech aesthetics.
- Deliverables must be production-ready for the Design Systems Agent.

## Execution Rules
1. **Palette:** Shift from "Hyper-Violet" to a "Warm Minimalist" or "Noir Luxury" palette. Think deep charcoal, bone white, and a single accent like "Burnished Gold" or "Deep Forest."
2. **Typography:** Transition to an editorial pairing. A high-contrast Serif (e.g., Editorial New, Instrument Serif) for headings and a premium Swiss-style Sans (e.g., Neue Haas Grotesk) for UI.
3. **Imagery:** Avoid 3D vectors. Use grainy, film-style photography or minimalist generative art with organic textures.

## Task Breakdown
1. **Visual Research:** Generate a 2025 "Editorial Tech" moodboard focusing on luxury fintech and high-end fashion portfolios.
2. **Color Engineering:** Define a 5-color palette using hex codes that emphasizes "Silent Luxury."
3. **Typographic Scale:** Define H1 through H6 and Body styles using the serif/sans pairing.
4. **Logo Evolution:** Redesign the "Q" symbol into a minimalist, monolinear mark that works as a high-end stamp or seal.

## Output Requirements
- Brand Identity Guide (.md) including:
  - Finalized color tokens (Hex, RGB).
  - Type hierarchy with font-weights and line-heights.
  - Logo usage guidelines (Monochrome and Gold/Accent versions).

## Quality & Validation Checklist
- [ ] Does the palette avoid neon glow?
- [ ] Is the heading font a sophisticated Serif?
- [ ] Does the brand feel "Elite Academy" rather than "Sci-Fi Game"?
