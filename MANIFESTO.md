# The QuestDAO Manifesto 🏛️

## 1. Hard BitBedrock
L1 Bitcoin is the only ledger that matters. Everything else is just noise or a temporary experiment. We don't build on Stacks because it's convenient; we build here because it's the only way to anchor high-logic Clarity contracts to the security of the prime chain. QuestDAO isn't a social experiment. It’s a guild for people who actually care about `post-conditions`, state transitions, and things that don't break when the hype dies.

## 2. Code or GTFO
Stop talking about "mastery" and start committing code. In this guild, your status is a direct reflection of your ability to handle traits, implement SIP-010 standards, and manage complex `read-only` functions without tripping. You don't buy your way in. You don't tweet your way in. You prove your competence by successfully calling the `quest-registry-v4` and minting your own reputation. If the contract rejects your transaction, you aren't ready. Simple as that.

## 3. The Architect’s Reality
We don't ask for permission. We build. In QuestDAO, the individual is the only unit of progress that counts. We use Clarity because its decidability means we actually know what the code will do before we run it. No surprises. No "move fast and break things." Just rigorous, predictable engineering for an economy that demands integrity. If you can't audit the contract, you're just a tourist.

## 4. Operation Rules

### Reputation is Non-Transferable
Your Soulbound Badges aren't NFTs to be flipped on Gamma. They're non-fungible proof of your technical sweat. We use `SIP-009` extensions with a hard burn-on-transfer rule. You want the status? Do the work. You can't delegate your knowledge to someone else's wallet.

### Power Follows Proven Merit
One-token-one-vote is a failure. It’s just plutocracy with a better UI. In the Council, we weight votes by your `architect-level`. Those who have cleared the most difficult quests and contributed the most secure code have the loudest voice. We trust the people who have shipped, not the people who have the most capital.

### Longevity by Design
Our smart contracts are built for a ten-year horizon, not a ten-day pump. We prioritize security and readable logic over gas optimization hacks that hide vulnerabilities. We're building the infrastructure for the sovereign individual. That requires an obsession with quality that borders on the fanatical.

## 5. The Threshold
The curriculum is brutal by design. Most people will drop out after the first module. Good. QuestDAO is for the few who are willing to spend their nights debugging `unwrap!` calls and mapping out complex DAO voting logic. 

**Build for Truth. Architect for Eternity.**
